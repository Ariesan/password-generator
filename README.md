# password-generator

I've created this following task from [scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript).
A Responsive app to generate random password is my second Solo Project. 
Which means, Scrimba Team, only given us specific requirement trough Figma, after that we have to create the app by our self.

**Requirement**

1. Array to hold all possible chars
2. Button to generate 4 random option
3. Display password option
4. Stretch :
    * Ability to set the password length
    * 1-click copy password to the clipboard
  
_*Stretch means* learner will earn extra point if able to provide requirement, because that specific requirement is not teach yet._ 

<br/>

 I use math.random & math.floor to create random password, and after that display all possible password into 4 area.

 For length of password, i ask user to input specific desired positive number, and grab that value for password length.

 After hours of googling and reading document, i know that navigator.clipboard.writetext() function, can make any text to be copied to clipboard. hence i can finish the second stretch, making user able to copy any choice of password.
