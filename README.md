# password-generator

I've created this following task from [scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript).
This is my second Solo Project. Whisc means, Scrimba Team, only given us specific requirement trough Figma, after that we have to create the app by our self.

**Requirement**

1. Array to hold all possible chars
2. Button to generate 4 random option
3. Display password option
4. Stretch :
    * Ability to set the password length
    * 1-click copy password to the clipboard
  
_*Stretch means* learner will earn extra point if able to provide requirement, because that specific requirement is not teach yet._ 


 I use math.random & math.floor to create random password, and after that display all possible password into 4 area.

 For length of password, i ask user to input specific desired positive number, and grab that value for password length/

 User also, able to copy any choice of password, using navigator.clipboard.writetext function.
